# write-model

The `write-model` exports two functions [`repositoryBuilder`](repositorybuilder.md) and [`commandServiceBuilder`](commandservicebuilder.md).

To initialize the model, you pass an `adapter` and `reducer` to the `repositoryBuilder` to generate a `repository`. Then you pass the `repository` and `actions` to the `commandServiceBuilder` to generate a list of commands 

## Example

```javascript
const {
  repositoryBuilder,
  commandServiceBuilder,
} = require('serverless-cqrs.write-mode')

const adapter = require('./adapter')
const reducer = require('./reducer')
const actions = require('./actions')

const repository = repositoryBuilder.build({
  adapter,
  reducer,
})

module.exports = commandServiceBuilder.build({
  repository,
  actions,
})
```

# repositoryBuilder

Takes a reducer and an adapter and returns a repository. A repository is the layer of our Onion Architecture \(see [Introduction](../../#event-sourcing-es)\) which handles data persistence.

The `write-model` repository has a single method called `getById`. When invoked, it uses the adapter to load all events for given ID and runs them through the reducer to calculate the current state. It returns an object that contains `state` and also a `save` method, which is used to append new events.

## Methods

### build

`build({ adapter, reducer })` 

builds a repository 

#### Parameters

| attribute | type | description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `adapter` | `object` | Any object which implements the write-model [Adapter Interface](../../advanced/repository/). |
| `reducer` | `function` | a function which, given a list of events, knows how to calculate the current state of an object. |

#### Returns

`{ getById }` - an object with the `getById` function.

### getById

`getById(id)` 

Loads and returns the current state of an entity. Also returns a `save` function for appending new events to the data store.

#### Parameters

| attribute | type | description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `id` | `string` | the id of the entity |

#### Returns

`{ state, save }` - an object containing an arbitrary `state` object, and a `save` function.

### save

`save(events)` 

Appends new events to the datastore

#### Parameters

| attribute | type | description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `events` | `array` | an array of arbitrary event objects |

#### Returns

`null`


# commandServiceBuilder

Takes a list of actions and a repository and returns an object where action names map to executable commands. 

Each command accepts an id and a payload.  When invoked, a command loads the current state of the entity from the repo and passes it, and the payload, to the action. The action will perform its validation and if successful, generate one or more events. The command forwards those events to the repository to be appended to the entity.

## Methods

### build

`build({ actions, repository })` 

Turns actions into commands that can be executed on real objects.

#### Parameters

| attribute | type | description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `actions` | `object` | [Domain](../../domain.md#actions) actions |
| `repository` | `object` | generated by the `repositoryBuilder` |

#### Returns

`commands` - where keys are actions names and values are functions which accept an `id` and `payload`
